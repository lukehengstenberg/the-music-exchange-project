# the-music-exchange-project
TheMusicExchangeProject implements an easy to use web application, establishing a new way for musicians of all abilities to connect. Providing a range of customisable search preferences, a relationship system, and a real-time messaging service, this project acts as a catalyst for pairing likeminded individuals. Powered by a large array of tools and frameworks including ASP.NET Core MVC, this project has produced a platform with an aesthetically pleasing client side and complex server side functionality. With a sophisticated database, the project has the ability to handle expansion as popularity increases and has been designed to be built upon in the future.
